Thank you for your kind attention. pp DID NFT Schemas are my passion. I have dozen of protocols which will entirely hinge on this incomplete technology. Remember that time will reveal that the only things that matter with privacy preserving DIDs is that we 1. make sure that they are private from inception, not vulnerable to any inference attacks, and 2. theat they are self custodied, to avoid censorship and surveillance, lest we create a dystopian future where our every move is watched and recorded and hand the tools to evil men.
