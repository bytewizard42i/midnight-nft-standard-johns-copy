# 🛡️ Digital Identity: The Interview

_“Privacy isn’t secrecy—it’s the right to choose what to share.”_

In my last [X Space](https://x.com/MidnightAlpha) on the **MidnightAlpha** channel, we were discussing **privacy-preserving digital identity**, and someone asked:

> ❓ _"What’s your favorite use-case for privacy-preserving DIDs?"_

Without a doubt, the most **practical showcase** for the need for **ppDIDz NFTs** has got to be the **Interview scenario**.

But before we get into that, let’s set the stage with the **Bar Scenario**, the original inspiration behind this idea.

## 🍷 The Bar Scenario

Watch the Hackathon Bar Demo 👉 [YouTube: Bar Scenario (Midnight Hackathon)](https://youtu.be/yihfR4Zb70U)

This scenario follows **Alice**, who’s traveling in **Italy**, where the legal drinking age is **18**. She wants to prove her age at a bar—**without revealing unnecessary private details.**

### The Problems:
- The **bartender** is _not_ a good actor and has an **exceptional memory**.
- There's a **security camera** above the bar, feeding footage to a **violent criminal** who watches the feed.

### Traditional Solution:
Present a **driver’s license**. But that reveals:
- Full name
- Date of birth
- Address
- License number
- And more…

That data can be copied, tracked, or sold—**without your consent**.

## ✅ The ppDIDz Solution with [DIDz DApp System™](https://enterprisezk.com/)

1. **Alice** generates a **ZKProof (Zero-Knowledge Proof)** on her phone and displays it as a **QR code**.
2. The bartender opens their **DIDz DApp**, scans the QR.
3. Alice inputs her **fingerprint or biometric** into the phone to verify identity ownership.
4. The app shows a **unique icon** on **both devices**, preventing **MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)** attacks.

🎯 Only **“Is over 18?” = YES** is shared.
> No name. No birthday. No address. No license number.

While this is a **great use case**, it’s not the most **practical** for everyday life.

## 👔 The Interview Scenario

💡 *I thought of this right after finishing the Bar Scenario video. I didn’t have time to include it in the hackathon, but it was too good to ignore!*

### 🏢 Problem: The Traditional Interview Process
When applying for a job:
- You're asked to fill out **extremely invasive applications**.
- There’s **no chain of custody** or visibility:
  - Who has access?
  - Where is it stored?
  - Who’s copying it?
  - What happens after the interview?

Even **before** the interview starts, you’ve likely handed over:
- Your full address
- Social Security Number
- Criminal record status
- Academic records
- Sensitive personal details

And it doesn’t stop there.

## 🔐 The DIDz DApp Alternative

A potential employer using DIDz can instead ask:

| Question                             | Revealed                    |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Is she a US citizen?                | ✅ YES *(No further info)* |
| Is she a felon?                     | ✅ NO *(No details)*       |
| Does she live close to the office?  | ✅ YES *(No address)*      |
| Has a Social Security Number?       | ✅ YES *(Not the number)*  |
| Has a college degree?               | ✅ YES *(No school listed)*|

> 🔍 If Alice *wants* to disclose more (e.g., "PhD in Molecular Biophysics from MIT"), she can—but **she's in control**.

---

## 📅 Temporary Access & Expiration

- Data can be set to **expire after 3 months**, if the company doesn't hire her.
- Alice can **revoke access** at any time.
- All disclosures are **trackable** and **permissioned**.

---

## 🥳 Let’s Say Alice Gets the Job...

She can choose to **formally connect** with the employer in the DIDz DApp:

- Unlock **payroll information**:
  - SSN
  - Address
  - Phone number

✅ But in the future:
- Government agencies like **SSA** could issue **verifiable claims** directly.
- These can be used **without revealing the raw data**.

Any party accessing this information must log in with their own **DID**—ensuring **chain of custody** and **accountability**.

---

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

I hope these scenarios gave you a better sense of how **DID NFTs** can **empower individuals**, **preserve privacy**, and **streamline identity verification**.

Let’s build a world where we **own our identities** and **share only what we choose.**
